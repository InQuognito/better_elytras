# Better Elytras
Have you ever wanted better customization for your Elytras in Minecraft? Introducing an all-new way to express yourself in Vanilla Minecraft, Better Elytras adds several new features to vanilla elytras!

## Dyeable Elytras
Elytras can now be dyed using the same system as leather armor! Simply combine them in a crafting table with dye.

## Trimmable Elytras
Elytras can now be trimmed with any of the vanilla armor trims! Our designs were inspired by the vanilla trims, but we added our own flair to them! Credit to @MiffenKop for the awesome trim textures.

## Known Issues
- Washing an Elytra will apply the leather armor color [#1](https://github.com/InQuognito/better_elytras/issues/1)
- Elytras are enchantable with chestplate enchantments. This is not a feature, rather a limitation I do not know how to bypass (yet) [#2](https://github.com/InQuognito/better_elytras/issues/2)
